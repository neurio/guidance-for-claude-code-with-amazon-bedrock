# ABOUTME: Regression test that every CodeBuild buildspec command parses as a YAML string
# ABOUTME: Guards against unquoted PowerShell ': ' + '{ }' lines that CodeBuild reads as mappings

"""Regression test for the Windows CodeBuild buildspec YAML bug.

The buildspecs are embedded as literal block scalars (``BuildSpec: |``) inside
``codebuild-windows.yaml``. A ``post_build`` command added by #472 was an
unquoted YAML scalar containing both a colon-space (``"FATAL: ..."``) and
PowerShell flow-mapping braces (``{ ... }``). CodeBuild's buildspec parser read
it as a YAML mapping instead of a string and failed every Windows build in
DOWNLOAD_SOURCE with::

    YAML_FILE_ERROR: Expected Commands[2] to be of string type: found subkeys
    instead at line 40, value of the key tag on line 39 might be empty

The precise oracle is dict-vs-str: a broken command parses to a ``dict``; a
correctly quoted one parses to a ``str``. cfn-lint does not catch this because
it validates the CloudFormation template, not the embedded buildspec's scalar
semantics.
