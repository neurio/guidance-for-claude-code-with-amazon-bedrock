# ABOUTME: Regression test for the executable_path UnboundLocalError (PR #320 bug 1)
# ABOUTME: Ensures a build failure before executable_path is assigned doesn't crash package

"""Regression test: package must not raise UnboundLocalError when a build fails early.

PR #320 bug 1: inside the per-platform build loop, ``executable_path`` is assigned by
``_build_executable()``. If that call raises before returning, the subsequent
``if platform_name == "windows" and executable_path is None`` check (reached when
monitoring is enabled) referenced an unbound local and crashed with UnboundLocalError
instead of falling through to the friendly "No binaries were successfully built" path.
