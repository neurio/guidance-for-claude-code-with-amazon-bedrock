# ABOUTME: Regression test for Windows-only ccwb package falsely reporting build failure
# ABOUTME: An async CodeBuild Windows build produces no local binary but is still a success

"""Regression test: a Windows-only package on a non-Windows host must not error.

When packaging only Windows from macOS/Linux with ``enable_codebuild=True``,
``_build_executable("windows")`` starts an asynchronous CodeBuild build and
returns ``None`` (no local binary yet). ``built_executables`` is therefore empty
even though the build was submitted successfully.

Commit 076da39 (#338, the Go rewrite) dropped the ``windows_codebuild_pending``
escape hatch, so the bare ``if not built_executables`` guard fired and the
command printed "Error: No binaries were successfully built." and returned 1 -
even though the CodeBuild build was running fine (confirmed live: the command
errored while ``ccwb builds`` showed the build In Progress). ``main`` still has
the correct guard; this test pins it on ``beta``.
