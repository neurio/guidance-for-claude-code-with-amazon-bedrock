# Plugin Distribution Guide

This guidance ships example Claude Code plugins demonstrating enterprise development patterns. These plugins work with both **Claude Code** (CLI) and **Claude Cowork** (Desktop) but are distributed differently depending on your deployment model.

> **⚠️ Important:** These are example starting points — fork and customize for your organization before production use. Adapt security policies, tooling integrations, and workflows to match your environment.

## Distribution Models

### Claude Code (developer-initiated)

Developers install plugins directly from this repository's marketplace using the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace source
/plugin marketplace add aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-claude-code-with-amazon-bedrock

# Install a specific plugin
/plugin install security@aws-claude-code-plugins

# Update all marketplace plugins
/plugin marketplace update
```

Plugins are stored in the user's local `.claude/plugins/` directory. Users choose which plugins to install and can remove them at any time.

**Official documentation:** [Discover and install plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins) | [Create a plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces)

### Claude Cowork on 3P (admin-managed)

For Cowork on third-party platforms (e.g., Amazon Bedrock), administrators provision plugins through the filesystem rather than the marketplace CLI. There are three extension layers, in order of precedence:

| Layer | Provisioned by | Delivered via |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Managed MCP servers | Admin | `managedMcpServers` configuration key |
| Organization plugins | Admin | System-wide directory on each device |
| User extensions | End user | In-app Connectors and Plugins UI |

**Organization plugins** are distributed by placing plugin directories on each device via MDM (Jamf, Intune, Group Policy) or your standard software distribution channel. Users cannot remove admin-provisioned plugins.

**Recommended workflow for Cowork 3P:**

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Customize** plugins for your organization (connectors, terminology, workflows, security policies)
3. **Push** the customized plugin directories to devices via MDM alongside the managed-settings configuration
4. Optionally disable the user extension layer if you want admin-only control

### Distribution Comparison

| Aspect | Claude Code | Cowork 3P (admin) |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Install mechanism | `/plugin marketplace add` (git-backed) | MDM push to filesystem |
| Who decides | Individual developer | IT administrator |
| Removable by user | Yes | No (org plugins) |
| Update mechanism | `/plugin marketplace update` | Re-push via MDM |
| MCP servers | Bundled in plugin `.mcp.json` | Bundled `.mcp.json` + separate `managedMcpServers` config key |
| Team enforcement | `.claude/settings.json` `requiredPlugins` | MDM policy |

## Plugin Component Differences

The plugin directory format is largely shared between Claude Code and Cowork, but each product supports different component types:

| Component | Claude Code | Cowork | Notes |
|-----------|:-----------:|:------:|-------|
| Skills (`skills/`) | ✅ | ✅ | Same format on both |
| Commands (`commands/`) | ✅ | ✅ | Slash commands |
| Agents/Sub-agents (`agents/`) | ✅ | ✅ | Same format on both |
| Hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) | ✅ | ✅ | Same lifecycle events |
| MCP servers (`.mcp.json`) | ✅ | ✅ | Called "connectors" in Cowork UI |
| LSP servers | ✅ | ❌ | Code intelligence (editor-only) |
| Monitors | ✅ | ❌ | Claude Code-specific |
| Themes | ✅ | ❌ | Terminal UI theming |
| Tool policy locks | ❌ | ✅ | Admin can set `allow`/`ask`/`blocked` per tool |

**Key behavioral differences:**

- **MCP server approval:** In Claude Code, users approve MCP server access at runtime. In Cowork org plugins, MCP servers are pre-approved by the administrator — users cannot block them.
- **Connectors vs MCP servers:** Cowork uses the term "connectors" in the UI for MCP servers. The underlying protocol (MCP) is the same.
- **Standalone MCP provisioning:** Cowork admins can deploy MCP servers *without* a plugin via the `managedMcpServers` configuration key. Claude Code requires MCP servers to be either in a plugin's `.mcp.json` or in the user's `.claude/settings.json`.
- **LSP/Monitors/Themes:** These are Claude Code-specific (terminal editor features). Plugins containing only these components won't provide any value when deployed to Cowork.

## Customization Before Deployment

These plugins are designed as **templates**, not turnkey solutions. Before deploying to your organization:

- **Security plugin:** Review PII patterns for your jurisdiction, adjust regex rules, configure audit log destinations
- **Architecture plugin:** Update architecture decision record (ADR) templates to match your standards
- **EPCC workflow:** Customize commit message formats, branch naming, and review processes
- **All plugins:** Update `.mcp.json` connector configurations to point at your internal tools

## Bootstrap Server Delivery (Dynamic)

`ccwb init` offers two dynamic delivery modes:

| Mode | What it delivers | Infrastructure |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Dynamic with plugins** (device-code auth) | Config + org plugins | API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB |
| **Dynamic config only** (OIDC Bearer) | Config only, no plugins | API Gateway + Lambda (stateless) |

### Setup (Dynamic with plugins — recommended)

```bash
ccwb init                      # Select "Dynamic with plugins" for CoWork delivery
ccwb deploy --stack bootstrap  # Deploy bootstrap server
ccwb plugins add --name my-plugin --repo https://github.com/org/plugins.git --path my-plugin
ccwb plugins sync              # Push registry to server
```

Desktop receives `organizationPluginsUrl` in the bootstrap response and git-clones plugins automatically. Plugins with `"installationPreference": "required"` install without user confirmation.

**How delivery works:** `ccwb plugins sync` uploads a registry JSON to the existing S3 bucket. The bootstrap Lambda reads it and serves it at `/plugins/index.json`. Each registry entry points to a git repo — Desktop clones directly from your repo, not through the bootstrap server.

**IdP callback:** Add the bootstrap callback URL (printed after deploy) to your IdP's redirect URIs. Cognito configures this automatically.

### Setup (Dynamic config only)

```bash
ccwb init                      # Select "Dynamic config only" for CoWork delivery
ccwb deploy --stack bootstrap  # Deploy lightweight bootstrap (no DynamoDB)
```

Desktop receives config (region, models, session lifetime) but no plugins. Simpler infrastructure, no state.
